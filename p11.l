;; P11  (*) Modified run-length encoding.
;;     Modify the result of problem P10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.

;;     Example:
;;     * (encode-modified '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
;;     ((4 A) B (2 C) (2 A) D (4 E))
